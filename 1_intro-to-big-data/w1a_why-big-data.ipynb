    "\n",
    "Practically speaking, technology needs to reach a certain level of maturity in conjunction with a socioeconomic environment, market demand, consumer readiness, and cost effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- reduced cost of data analysis\n",
    "- increased availability of cheap data storage\n",
    "- increased digitization of previously analog data records\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- describe how the combination of an increase in data and on-demand computing has launched the field of data science\n",
